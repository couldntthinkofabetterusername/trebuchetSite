<p>We're the class of 2020, and this is the first year iDEA has existed. We're working hard to make it ours.</p>

<p>Our period's sling was called "The Swove". 
  It was made through the process of ~7 layers of duct tape and ~4 layers of masking tape. 
  The masking tape was criss crossed to ensure that it would not stretched. 
  The masking tape was used in this way because masking tape does not stretch as much as duct tape does. 
  The Swove was cut on the edges (as it was too long) and the edges were turned upward to 
  form a sort of bowl shape to keep the tennis ball from falling out. 
  This plan was not successful as the ball kept falling out. 
  During the final launch, The Swove got more duct tape around the edge to add to the bowl design.
  The Swove was quiet consistent in its failure as the tennis ball consistently fell out of the back of sling. 
  We believe that The Swove performed the way it did because of the texture of the material used to make it. 
  Duct tape is notoriously slippery and it would be very easy for the tennis ball to slip out of the sling.

Our period's trebuchet had no name, but went through a few changes. We added more nuts and bolts around the long arm and counterweight box so it would remain stable. Adjustments were made the the hooks on the trebuchet to maximize rope efficiency.</p>
